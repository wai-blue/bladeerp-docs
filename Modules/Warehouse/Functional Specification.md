## Stock Management
"Stock management" in an ERP system refers to the processes and tools used by a company to control and track its inventory efficiently. It involves monitoring the quantities, locations, and statuses of products within the organization's warehouses or storage facilities. Stock management in ERP typically includes functionalities such as:
* Inventory Tracking: Keeping real-time records of product quantities on hand.
* Replenishment: Ensuring that inventory levels are maintained at optimal levels by reordering products when they fall below predetermined thresholds.
* Order Fulfillment: Processing customer orders by picking, packing, and shipping products from the available stock.
* Location Management: Organizing products within the warehouse, often using bins or storage locations, to make them easy to locate.
* Reporting: Generating reports and analytics to gain insights into inventory turnover, demand patterns, and stock-related costs.
* Integration: Coordinating stock management with other parts of the ERP system, such as procurement, sales, and accounting, to maintain accurate and up-to-date data.

## Products / Warehouse items
In an ERP system, "products" or "warehouse items" refer to the items or goods that a company buys, manufactures, or sells. These products can include tangible physical items like electronics, clothing, or machinery, as well as intangible items like software licenses or services. Within the ERP, each product is typically identified by a unique code or SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for easy tracking and management. The ERP system helps companies manage their products by storing information about them, including descriptions, pricing, suppliers, and stockroom levels. This data is crucial for various business processes, such as procurement, sales, and stockroom control.
