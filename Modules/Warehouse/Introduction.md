# Module Warehouse [WHS]

A warehouse in an ERP system is a dedicated and organized physical or virtual storage location where a company manages and maintains its inventory, raw materials, and finished goods. It serves as a central hub for storing, tracking, and managing all types of products and materials that are essential for the company's operations.

Stock management helps companies ensure that they have the right products available in the right quantities to meet customer demand while minimizing excess inventory or stockouts. It simplifies the complex task of overseeing inventory and streamlines various related processes for better operational efficiency and cost control.
