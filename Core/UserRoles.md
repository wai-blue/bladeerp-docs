# Core/UserRoles

## Default user role

BladeERP is using following one default user role: an administrator.

## Module-based user roles

Each module of the BladeERP can extend the list of available user roles by its default configuration.

For example, the module `Bookkeeping` defines the roles `Main accountant` and `Accountant`. Other modules can define other user roles.

## Custom user roles

The administrator can define custom user roles and configure the permission for each single functionality.
